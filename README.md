# Sorting-Visualiser

Welcome to Sort Spectra a Sorting Visualizer! I built this application because I was fascinated by sorting algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it.

## Meet the Algorithms

This application supports the following algorithms:

**Bubble Sort:** The simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

**Selection Sort:** A simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list.

**Quick Sort:** A sorting algorithm based on the Divide and Conquer algorithm that picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot by placing the pivot in its correct position in the sorted array.

**Heap Sort:** A comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to the selection sort where we first find the minimum element and place the minimum element at the beginning. Repeat the same process for the remaining elements.

**Insertion Sort:** A simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

## Notes

This application is built on React & SASS. Feedbacks are appreciated.
